    <description value="Concepts describing a person's self-reported type of work, i.e., the set of activities or tasks that the person is paid to perform or, if unpaid, the person's contribution to a household/family business/community. The value set was created by coding the O*NET-SOC alternate titles, which are relatable to the general public, to facilitate collection and validation by patients. A downloadable file available from the PHIN VADS ODH Hot Topics section is structured to support computer-assisted searching of this value set. The file also contains a crosswalk from the concepts in this value set to Occupation_CDC_Census value set concepts."/>
